#### What's it? ####

It's a Simple Firefox OS App.

#### What can it do? ####

Just look at the time in moment.

#### Get the Clock ####

I still doing test and build. Visiting [this app](http://www.tychio.net/opportuniry) and click add to screen on your mobile browers.

#### My Goal ####

* Better UI and UE make you as soon as possible master the time.

* It not only can told you what's the time, but also can told you what's sky of color now.

* Of cause! Alarm function.

* I might build a list at backside as todo list, but it's a hotchpotch.

#### Report ####

Thank you for any reports whether bugs on verious device or thinks for app function.
